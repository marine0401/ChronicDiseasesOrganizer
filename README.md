The system domain is health-care, where the focus is on serving patients of all ages by organizing their measurements and improve their life quality.
Health-care related applications are rising fast. Therefore, choosing a health management application is confusing for users and challenging for mobile applications developers, offering such as (Miqyas) application with our native language will be such an advantage. In the design phase, we took into consideration that all ages should be benefited from the application, so the design was simple, clear and comforts the eyes.
Miqyas System allows patients to record their measurements in one secure place, generate the best lifestyle, and allow the doctor to diagnosis patient easily, as well as participating in the proposed lifestyle.
So, the conclusion is that we have a user-friendly application with the use of machine learning to enhance the prediction level.
Miqyas has been successfully developed. We implemented all of the functions planned to do before.

It was developed using Android Studio (XML and Java), Anaconda (Python) for machine learning and Firebase for database creation and records management.
